# 2.5.1.7 LAB: Palindromes

LAB

Estimated time
15-30 minutes

Level of difficulty
Easy

Objectives

- improving the student's skills in operating with strings;
- encouraging the student to look for non-obvious solutions.

## Scenario

Do you know what a palindrome is?

It's a word which look the same when read forward and backward. For example, "kayak" is a palindrome, while "loyal" is not.

Your task is to write a program which:

- asks the user for some text;
- checks whether the entered text is a palindrome, and prints result.

Note:

- assume that an empty string isn't a palindrome;
- treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
- spaces are not taken into account during the check - treat them as non-existent;
- there are more than a few correct solutions - try to find more than one.

Test your code using the data we've provided.
## Test data
```
Sample input:
Ten animals I slam in a net

Sample output:
It's a palindrome
```
```
Sample input:
Eleven animals I slam in a net

Sample output:
It's not a palindrome
```
