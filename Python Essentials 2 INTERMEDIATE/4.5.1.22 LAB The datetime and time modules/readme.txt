Level of difficulty

Easy

Objectives

    improving the student's skills in date and time formatting;
    improving the student's skills in using the strftime method.

Scenario

During this course, you learned about the strftime method, which requires knowledge of directives to create a format. It's time to put the known directives into practice.

By the way, you'll have the opportunity to practice working with documentation, because you'll have to find directives that you don't yet know.
Here's your task:

Write a program that creates a datetime object for November 4, 2020 , 14:53:00. The object created should call the strftime method with the appropriate format to display the following result:
2020/11/04 14:53:00
20/November/04 14:53:00 PM
Wed, 2020 Nov 04
Wednesday, 2020 November 04
Weekday: 3
Day of the year: 309
Week number of the year: 44

expected output

Note: Each result line should be created by calling the strftime method with at least one directive in the format argument.
