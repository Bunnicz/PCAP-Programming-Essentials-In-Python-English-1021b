Objectives

- improving the student's skills in operating with strings and lists;
- converting strings into lists.

## Scenario

As you probably know, Sudoku is a number-placing puzzle played on a 9x9 board. The player has to fill the board in a very specific way:

- each row of the board must contain all digits from 0 to 9 (the order doesn't matter)
- each column of the board must contain all digits from 0 to 9 (again, the order doesn't matter)
- each of the nine 3x3 "tiles" (we will name them "sub-squares") of the table must contain all digits from 0 to 9.

If you need more details, you can find them here.

Your task is to write a program which:

- reads 9 rows of the Sudoku, each containing 9 digits (check carefully if the data entered are valid)
- outputs Yes if the Sudoku is valid, and No otherwise.

Test your code using the data we've provided.
